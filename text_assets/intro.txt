It's cold out. 
You stopped counting the miles.  It seemed a bit pointless after so many... 
You finally found your way though, the dark maw of the cavern now before you. 
You don't feel fear.  You've never felt fear.  Fear is the mind killer. 
No, you feel nothing but the drive to complete your task. 

Your fire is warm, and lights the front of the cave.  Somehow, even with the light 
of the flames, the hollow center seems darker than night; as though the cavern 
were simply consuming the light.  This cavern consumes hope. 

You rise to your feet.  They ache, though this feeling is now the familiar standard. 
Your armor is worn, and slightly rusted.  The product of months of travel through 
the harsh terrain.  There is a mist, and the grey clouds mask any sun that might 
attempt to shine through; the same as they'd done since you entered this forsaken 
land.
